#My firts Project

# Printf()
this project was made by Leyner Lopez and Daiver Contreras, holberton students in software development.

this project consists of implementing our own printf functionin this case our
function called "_printf", which is a function that performs the conversion of
the formatted output and the printing of data. Its prototype is as follows:

#### int _printf(const char *format, ...)

where format constains the string that is printed.

If the program runs successfully, the return value is the amount of chars printed.
